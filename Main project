We are going to create a function that shows the relationship between height and weight for a healthy body using Python. This is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI).

Data:
We have a table that shows the average weight of a healthy body for different heights.

Height (in inches)	58	60	61	64	66	69	70	71	72	73
Weight (in pounds)	102	109	113	125	133	146	149	153	158	162
Source: American Cancer Society

What We Will Do:
Use Python: We'll use Python to calculate a line that best fits the given data. This line will help us predict the weight for any given height.
Linear Regression: The method we'll use is called linear regression. It helps us find the best-fitting straight line through a set of points.
How It Works:
Collect Data: We have the heights and corresponding weights.
Plot Data: We'll plot this data on a graph.
Find the Line: Using Python, we'll calculate the line that best fits this data. This line is called the regression line.
Predict: With this line, we can predict the average weight for any height.

I used this function to help me find BestfitLine.

# Create the list for the data h is the heigh of the person w is the average wei!
h= [58,60,61,64,66,69,70,71,72,73]
w= [102,109,113,125,133,146,149,153, 158,162]
def bestFitLine(x,y) :
    N= len (x)
    sx=0 # the sum of x values
    sy=0 # the sum of y values
    sxy=0 # The sum of product of corresponding x and y values
    sx2=0 # The sum of squers of x values
    for i in range(N):
        sx=sx+x[i]
        sy=sy+y [i]
        sxy=sxy+x[i]*y[i]
        sx2=sx2+x[i]*x[i]
    m= (N*sxy-sx*sy) / (N*sx2-sx*sx)
    b=(sy-m* sx)/N
    return m,b  


I used this function to find correlation coefficient

# Create the function to find connelation coefficient.
def corrCoefficient(x,y):
    N=len (x)
    sx=0 # the sum of x values
    sy=0 # the sum of y values
    sxy=0 # The sum of product of corresponding x and y values
    sx2=0 # The sum of squers of x values
    sy2=0 # The sum of squers of y values
    for i in range(N):
        sy=sy+y[i]
        sxy=sxy+x[i]*y[i]
        sx2=sx2+x[i]*x[i]
        sy2=sy2+y[i]*y[i]
        r=(N*sxy-sx*sy)/np. sqrt((N*sx2-sx*sx) * (N*sy2-sy*sy))
        return r
