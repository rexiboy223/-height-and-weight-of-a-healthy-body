We are going to create a function that shows the relationship between height and weight for a healthy body using Python. This is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI).

Data:
We have a table that shows the average weight of a healthy body for different heights.

Height (in inches)	58	60	61	64	66	69	70	71	72	73
Weight (in pounds)	102	109	113	125	133	146	149	153	158	162

What We Will Do:
Use Python: We'll use Python to calculate a line that best fits the given data. This line will help us predict the weight for any given height.
Linear Regression: The method we'll use is called linear regression. It helps us find the best-fitting straight line through a set of points.
How It Works:
Collect Data: We have the heights and corresponding weights.
Plot Data: We'll plot this data on a graph.
Find the Line: Using Python, we'll calculate the line that best fits this data. This line is called the regression line.
Predict: With this line, we can predict the average weight for any height.
